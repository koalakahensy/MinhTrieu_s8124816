## Project Overview

This project entails the development of a personal portfolio website to showcase my professional experience in Advertising, Public Relations, and Media. Having completed a 3-year Professional Communications program at RMIT Vietnam and RMIT Melbourne, this website serves as a platform to effectively present myself and my relevant skills to potential employers. The website will be built using HTML and CSS, with initial development taking place within the Microsoft Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE).

## Technical Specifications

**Development Languages**: HTML, CSS

**Initial Development Environment**: Microsoft Visual Studio IDE

**Multimedia Integration**: The website will feature various multimedia elements, including YouTube videos, photographs, and potentially presentations in the future.

**Visual Design**: The website will utilize a bright color scheme, with primary colors (#a5d5d5 and #82eefd) chosen to reflect my personality: trustworthiness, competence, and youthful peacefulness. Readability will be prioritized by maintaining high color contrast and employing a clear font family (Roboto). In CSS I will try to center content and create clear separation between website sections for enhanced user navigation.

**Image and Video Quality**: All multimedia content will be at least HD 720p resolution to ensure consistency with the overall website quality.

## Future Development

**Content Expansion**: The website will be adaptable to accommodate additional multimedia content such as presentations, photos, and videos showcasing past projects and contributions.

**Website Sections**: Future development plans include incorporating sections dedicated to my portfolio, a personal gallery, and a contact form.

**Responsive Design**: CSS media queries will be implemented to enable responsive web design, ensuring the website adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.

## Limitations of HTML and CSS

While HTML and CSS are powerful tools for website development, it's important to acknowledge their limitations:

**Static Languages**: HTML and CSS are static languages, meaning they are not ideal for creating highly interactive or dynamic websites.

**Data Management**: These languages lack functionalities for data storage or manipulation. For more advanced features, server-side scripting languages like PHP or ASP.NET might be necessary.

**Complex Layouts**: While basic layouts and styles can be achieved with HTML and CSS, complex design elements may require additional frameworks or design tools like Photoshop.

**Advanced Tasks**: HTML and CSS are not suited for tasks like advanced image manipulation or video processing. These functionalities might require the use of external tools or libraries.

By understanding these limitations, I can plan for future website development using appropriate technologies to achieve the desired level of interactivity and functionality.
